## Introduction

This application is designed to manage discount codes (promo codes) for sales or promotions. It provides a REST API for creating, updating, and using promo codes, as well as managing products and simulating purchases. The backend is developed using Java and the Spring framework, with an in-memory H2 database for data storage

## Features

- Create, edit, and list products
- Create, list, and get details of promo codes
- Calculate discount price for a product with a promo code
- Simulate a purchase and store purchase information with or without a promo code

## Elements

- Product: Represents a product that can be purchased. 
    - Attributes: name, description, regular price, currency
- Promo Code: Represents a discount code that can be applied to a product.
  - Attributes: code (Unique text identifier with 3-24 alphanumeric case-sensitive characters.), expiration date, discount amount, currency, max usages, type (fixed or percentage)
- Purchase: Represents a purchase of a product.
    - Attributes: date, product, regular price, discount amount

- Discount Calculation:
    - Fixed: discount price = regular price - promo code discount
    - Percentage: discount price = regular price - (regular price * promo code discount)
    - Validates promo code existence, expiration date, currency match, and usage limit.
